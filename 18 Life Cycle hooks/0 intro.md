A component instance has a lifeclye that starts when Angular instantiates the component class and renders the component views along with it's child views ..

The lifecyle contines with change detection , as Angular checks to seee when data-bound properties change , and updates both the view and the component instance as needed 


The lifecycle ends when Angular destroyes the component instance and removes its rendered template from the DOM
